# ICLFF

## Independence County Library Friends Foundation

I was hired to build this website by the Independence County Library Friends Foundation (ICLFF), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit in Batesville, Arkansas. I was asked to build the site so they would look more legitimate to donors, and to make donating easier for donors. Since they had very simple needs, and didn't need a full enterpise-level site, I figured a Wordpress/Elementor site would best suit their needs. The speed with which I was able to build this site allowed them to reach donors and receive donations quickly.

As this nonprofit is headquartered in the town where I live, I was able work closely with one of the group's members to determine the design of the site, mainly how many pages the site needed. Aside from this, I was given carte blanche to design and build the site.

Things I took into consideration when building the site:
- Ensuring the link to the donation page was easy to spot
- Doing my best to make sure accessability standards were met
- Making sure any copy was easy to read
- Making sure PDFs embedded on the site were easy to download, and if they were, adding instructions to assist users who had trouble with this.
- Optimizing site elements for mobile responisitivity

I also learned how to embed PDFs on Wordpress sites.
